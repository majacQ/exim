# It is rather difficult to properly test spf.  We use libspf2 to do the work, and it
# does the DNS lookups, so we cannot intercept them in the testsuite's usual fashion
# to provide values for testcases.
#
# For now just check that what should be working syntax does not cause us to fall over.
# Be careful with envelope-domains and IPs used for testcases, as real DNS lookups will be done.
